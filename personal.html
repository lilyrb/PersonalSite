<h3> Fun Facts / Brags </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>I have a Crown of Wonder and a full gem collection (have yet to trade for the second crown though) </li>
		<li>I have the chair from Alyssa's Star Challenge </li>
		<li>I have reached the max friendship level with Arte Fact so he tells me when he's selling rares</li>
		<li>My actual favourite arcade game is Spree! but it's barely even a game so I didn't include it on the list</li>
		<li>I got my mom back into Webkinz. She has an account that she plays on pretty regularly :) </li>
		<li>I tend to not collect the plushies (as they take up a lot of space) unless I really want it or it has a tag, but even then only if it's a pet I don't already have </li>
		<li>Some of my favourite pets to collect are the Zum Buddies but I don't have any digital versions :(</li>
		<li>I do, however, have a zumzclip which is attached to my backpack. His name is Zool</li>
		<li>I still have access to my original account from childhood but it's not a full player account so I tend to just play on the account on display here I made in 2020</li>
	</ul>
